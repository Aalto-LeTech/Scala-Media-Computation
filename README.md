# The Scala Media Computation Library (SMCL)

This project is targeted mainly for instructors and students of introductory programming courses. From instructors' viewpoint, its goal is to provide means to motivate students via contextualized teaching. There are many ways to provice context, and the approach choosen here is the one of multimedia computation, that is, programmatically creating and processing multimedia content in a creative way. To provide the necessary scaffolding for novice students already challenged to learn for example logical and algorithmic thinking, programming concepts and paradigms, a new programming language (in this case, [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)), and the related development tools, this library offers ways to concentrate only in the topics to be practiced while still producing hopefully interesting and attractive results.

## Project Structure

## Tools & Dependencies

...


## Repository Content

The repository contains only the files needed to create a fresh development setup of the project: source code and other resources as well as the initial settings for the build tool.


## Making a Local Copy

One possibility to clone this repository onto your local mass storage is to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) itself. From command line this can be done like below:
```
git clone https://github.com/Aalto-LeTech/Scala-Media-Computation.git
```
This will create a `Scala-Media-Computation` folder into the folder in which it is executed. Other possibilities to clone the repository include e.g. IDE plugins and other graphical user interfaces developed to make using of Git easier.


## Building the Library

This library uses [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) as its build tool. 

Build products---including the packaged Java archives (.jar files)---are located under the generated `<project>/js/target` and `<project>/jvm/target` folders.


## Developing with IntelliJ IDEA
